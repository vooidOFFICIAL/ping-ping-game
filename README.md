Description of your project.

### Installation

Before running the code, make sure to install Pygame. Open your terminal and enter the following command:

```bash
pip install pygame


3.
Running the Code:

We recommend executing the code in your terminal, especially if you are using Linux. Navigate to your project directory and use the following command:

python your_script_name.py

Replace 'your_script_name.py' with the actual name of your Python file.

This ensures that the instructions are clear and well-formatted. Users can easily copy and run the steps in their terminal. If you want to emphasize the command lines strongly, you can also use inline code syntax (surrounding with backticks).
